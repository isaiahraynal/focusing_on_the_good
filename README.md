*focusing_on_the_good_code.R* has the code used for all analyses in the main text as well as the supplementary analyses on a) non-partisan groups and b) split by partisanship (does not include descriptive analyses of demographic data, as that was mostly just done by table(data$variable))

*focusing_on_the_good_data.csv* has the merged data collected from my survey experiment and the demographic data collected from the background survey of the student sample for those who took my study

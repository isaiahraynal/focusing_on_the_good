Code and data for "Focusing on the Good in Outgroup Members: The Potential of Priming Positive Characteristics for Improving Intergroup Affect" project.

# Abstract

Animosity between Republicans and Democrats continues to increase in the United States as outpartisans hyper-focus on the negative aspects of each other. In this paper, I present the results of an original vignette survey experiment where I test whether priming Americans to think about the positive characteristics possessed by a member of the opposite party can improve attitudes.  My study tests attitudes both towards outpartisan members of the mass public as well as elites. I find that the positive effect of priming positive characteristics and the negative effect of mentioning outpartisanship seem to cancel each other out, suggesting that positive characteristics are strong enough to counteract outpartisan animosity.  I find that while this intervention is successful at improving attitudes at the individual-level, it does not extend to the larger group. These results suggest that priming Americans of the opposite party to think about the good in each other is a promising start to reducing affective polarization.
